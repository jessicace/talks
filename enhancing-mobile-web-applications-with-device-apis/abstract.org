* Abstract
- With more and more users browsing the web on mobile devices, the web
  community now largely understands how important it is to design and
  implement our sites with the assumption that it will be viewed on a
  small screen. 
- Responsive web design is only one piece of the puzzle, however. A
  mobile device is more than just a smaller viewport. The technology
  available to your average mobile device varies considerably to the
  average desktop or laptop computer.  
- In this session, I will show how developers can enhance their web
  applications to take advantage of hardware features via device APIs,
  without sacrificing the overall experience for users accessing the
  application from non-mobile devices.
