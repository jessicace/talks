* Wake Lock API
** [[https://www.w3.org/TR/wake-lock/][Wake Lock API]]
   - Working Draft 16 March 2016
   - Prevent aspect of device from entering power saving state
   - E.g. turning off the screen
   - Allows web applications to request a wake lock
   - Working draft
*** Examples
      #+BEGIN_SRC js
// request to keep the display awake when the recipe is showing:
screen.keepAwake = true;

// stop keeping the display awake:
screen.keepAwake = false;
  
  #+END_SRC
*** Wake Lock
    - only deals with screen wake lock.
    -
*** Extension to Screen interface
    -
*** Requesting Wake Locks
    - Each browsing context has a request flag for the wake lock.
    - Set to false to cancel.
    - Can only request - you would not get an error.
    - 
    -
*** Managing Wake Locks
    - Browser requests the operating system to apply the lock.
    - Browser requests the operating system to release the lock.
    - Browsing context is only relevant with its visible
    - For a user:
      - browser tab / window is closed
      - change tabs
      - browser minimised
      - navigate or reload page
      - wake lock applies again if the keepAwake attribute is still true
*** Additional lock types
    - E.g. prevent cpu, radio, etc from entering power saving state,
      whilst letting the screen switch off.

*** Keeping the screen awake
    - Flashlight
    - Cooking recipes
    - Navigate to a destination
    - reading an e-book
    - touch enabled signage
*** Keeping the system awake
    - Display uses a large amount of power - prolong battery life of a
      device
    - applications should not necessarily stop running -
      e.g. attaching large files to an email
** Misc
   - Since the API extends the Screen interface defined by the CSS WG
     in the CSSOM View module, the CSS WG might wish to confirm this
     extension is in-line with the design of the interface.
   - Likewise, since the API relies on the Page Visibility state
     defined by the WebPerf WG, that group might wish to comment on
     the proper usage of that signal.
