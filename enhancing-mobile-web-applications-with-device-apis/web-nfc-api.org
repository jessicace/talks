* Web NFC API
** [[https://www.broken-links.com/2015/07/23/hardware-apis-coming-to-browsers/][Hardware APIs coming to browsers - Broken Links]]
   - Further from implementation is the Web NFC API, which gives
     access to Near Field Communication devices – such as tap-to-pay
     systems. Currently only at the spec stage, it’s also
     Promise-based so seems easy to get started with. 
   - For example, this is how it’s proposed to read data from an NFC
     device: 
     #+BEGIN_SRC js
       navigator.nfc.requestAdapter().then(function (adapter) {
         adapter.onmessage = function (event) {
           console.log(event.message.data);
         }
       });
     #+END_SRC
